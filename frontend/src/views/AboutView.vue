        Hey, I´m Guillermo.
        <br /><br />
        I´m a software developer student in the University of Salamanca, Spain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I´m working and learning about web development under the
        tutelage of Bisite Research Group. I´m really enjoying. This website
        means a lot to me, because it´s my first project with Vue.js. I´m
        looking forward to learning more about web development and software
        engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find me at <span class="text-gray-900">gpm@usal.es</span>
